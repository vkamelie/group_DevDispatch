Quality assurance testing for software development is key to any company’s release of reliable useful technology. Testing is a small, but important piece of the software development life cycle. Quality assurance also serves as an entry-point in the competitive tech work space while allowing testers to explore where in development they want their career to go.\nQuality Assurance (QA) engineers are essential members on software development teams. In any industry, organizations have different preferences for testing their software.  Testing and QA roles have become essential to teams frequently delivering quality software.\n\nContinuous integration and continuous development are usually coupled with an agile methodology to maintain order among frequent deployment chaos. As continuous integration and deployment become more common,  these processes and methodologies are best coupled with an automated testing system. Following agile methodologies, a feature is declared done when it is tested and deployed. Testing is typically the last line of defense before software is released to suer.\n\nQA engineers are meaningful employees to any organization that builds software.

You need 21st-century skills and to be prepared for the workplace today, so we've brought the workplace inside a school. 42 has no teachers, courses, or classes, because the workplace doesn't have them. Instead, we use project-based and problem-based learning along with peer-correction (like code review) to foster a tight-knit learning environment. Students learn soft skills, creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and how to work in teams. They have to give and receive correction, defend their code, and adhere to Norms.\n\nWith 42 Starfleet Academy, students control when they learn and how they learn. Starfleeters have a set curriculum they must follow and complete in 12 months. The program is designed to develop strong, well-founded software engineers, particularly those who want to work at top-level tech companies. The program is intense but students form a tight-knit community with other Starfleeters.\n\nOur system is gamified through experience points, levels, and correction points. Our curriculum is skills or mastery-based, meaning you don't advance to the next level until you've displayed mastery of the skills for the level that you're on. Your software has to work and if it doesn't, you have to go back and fix it, because that's what you do in the real world.\n\nAdmissions is based on merit: we don't ask for GPAs, test scores, degrees, essays, or references.

          "Intensive Basic Training is an immersive coding experience. It's the admissions process for 42 Silicon Valley. This 28-day intensive session is designed to push students, create a learning community, and develop basic coding skills.\n\nEvery day, 7 days a week, students must complete coding challenges and exercises. They are released at 8:42am daily and are due at 11:42pm.\n\nThere are no teachers, courses, or classes. Students don't attend lectures. Instead, you code.\n\nOur program is designed to reflect the real-world life of a software engineer: you have projects, you work individually and in teams, and your superiors don't necessarily know the answer to your question. Instead, you use the people around you and the resources available on the internet to figure out, test, and improve solutions.\n\nMany students say Basic Training was a great life experience. Other say they learned more in 1 week of Basic Training than they did in 4 years of college.\n\nThe goal of Intensive Basic Training is to prepare you for 42, provide an opportunity to students to see if you like to code and thus a career as a software engineer, and to serve as the admissions process for the school. We like using C. It is not a bootcamp and do not expect to get a job at the end. This is just the beginning :)\n\n42 Silicon Valley runs 4-8 Basic Training sessions per year. They are all free.",

          "The 42 program is a self-paced program that ranges from 1-5 years for completion. Students at 42 Silicon Valley tend to spend 7-15 months at 42 before finding jobs or gaining internships and thus they tend to leave before finishing level 21. Students at the Paris campus tend to stay longer but don't live on campus.\n\n42 trains you for the digital world. You need 21st-century skills and to be prepared for the workplace today, so we've brought the workplace inside a school. 42 has no teachers, courses, or classes, because the workplace doesn't have them. Instead, we use project-based and problem-based learning along with peer-correction (like code review) to foster a tight-knit learning environment. Students learn soft skills, creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and how to work in teams. They have to give and receive correction, defend their code, and adhere to Norms.\n\nAt 42 students control what they learn, when they learn, and how they learn. Our system is gamified through experience points, levels, and correction points. Our curriculum is skills or mastery-based, meaning you don't advance to the next level until you've displayed mastery of the skills for the level that you're on. Your software has to work and if it doesn't, you have to go back and fix it, because that's what you do in the real world.\n\nAdmissions is based on merit: we don't ask for GPAs, test scores, degrees, essays, or references. You have to survive Intensive Basic Training which is a 28-day intensive coding challenge that takes place on campus. It's an intensive learning process with 12-15 hour days, but you don't need to have any priori coding experience to do well.\n\n99% of students level 10 or above are employed or interning who want to have a job - some want to pursue more levels.\n\nWe do not guarantee employment and we do not do job placement because 42 is about training for the real world, and in the real world, you need to learn the art of the job application process. However, 42 has strong relationships with employers and companies in the area and already has internship and hiring programs with companies specifically for 42 students.\n\nWe do not provide visas and do not provide any assistance with visas.\n\nWe count graduation as students who finish level 21 - only students are counted as alumni whenever they get employed or intern, so we have alumni before we have graduates.",

Whether you want to go straight into a Junior Developer career, or prefer to get a leg up before starting uni, this course was made with you in mind. Think of GenTech as the younger sibling of our highly successful Fast Track bootcamp.\n\nGenTech could be for you if you...\n- have recently left school and want a career in technology, but have missed out on training\n- are a great problem solver & high achiever, but need to build confidence in 21st century skills\n- want a fast track to a great career or to feeling super confident in STEM at university\n\nDuring our time working with schools, we’ve noticed that students aren’t receiving sufficient coding & stem training. (We’re working on it!) This means students like you aren’t quite prepared for computer science, IT, or engineering degrees straight out of school, which leads to high dropout rates - especially for young women. GenTech was designed as an intensive year-long coding course to help these students build a foundation to succeed in a stem university degree, or if they prefer, to provide access to fantastic career opportunities as a junior developer.\n\n\nHANDS-ON, ENGAGING LEARNING\nFocus on honing your coding skills in a collaborative and inspiring environment with like-minded classmates.\n\nMEET THE EXPERTS\nFoster strong industry relationships through coder academy’s network. With access to contacts from top tier tech companies, students develop meaningful connections with expert educators, mentors, guest speakers, and industry partners.\n\nCOMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT\nAustralia has a tight-knit developer community for students to get involved in. Set yourself apart by building valuable experience while you learn. Attend industry excursions, local hackathons, and other tech events.\n\nIN-DEMAND TECH SKILLS\nGraduate with the most in-demand, industry relevant set of programming skills in two technology stacks – Ruby on Rails & JavaScript mern stack (mongo, express, react & node).\n\nINDUSTRY EXPERIENCE\nUnlike university, colleges, or other bootcamp programs, Coder Academy coordinates a structured one month cadetship in industry.\n\nTo enhance student learning, a key component of the GenTech program is introducing students to experts from industry and getting them comfortable with what is expected in the workplace. Coder Academy brings in numerous mentors from big tech companies like Atlassian, Gumtree Australia, and Amazon Web Services, and more, as well representatives from startups and agencies. Outside of the classroom, students are encouraged to partake in community tech events like hackathons, Meetups, and excursions.\n\nUnlike most education providers, Coder Academy is passionate about ensuring all of our students gain industry experience during the course of their study. During GenTech, students will partake in a 4-week long cadetship with anywhere between one and four companies in order to build connections, and better understand the demands and opportunities in the workplace. Students are matched with appropriate cadetship providers based on their career aspirations and performance during the bootcamp.",

The course will allow you to be substantially knowledgeable in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from concept to finished product and the ability to specialize, if they choose, in anything from front-end to back-end development technologies.\n\nYou will obtain the knowledge and skills to develop relational databases and work with data that is not stored in a relational manner. They will interact with their own API’s and third party API’s. They will also be exposed to many User Interface and User Experience (UI and UX) () design concerns while building an understanding of how to gather customer and client requirements. They will be fluent in performing quality assurance testing and fundamental security concerns.  \n\nSpecifically, the course will produce a programmer/developer that can work with many of the most popular design patterns, third party APIs, libraries and technologies including but not limited to: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MVVM, MVC, AngularJS, jQuery, Ajax, Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection, Principles of Object Oriented Design, Data Structures, Data Access, Database Design and Architecture, GIS, SMS, SMTP and RESTFul Api Design.\n\nSabio focuses on a single, group based project that exposes you to the full Software Development Life Cycle as experienced in a team practicing Agile/Scrum project management and development principles.",
